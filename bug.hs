This Haskell code attempts to use the `length` function on an infinite list, which will cause it to run indefinitely.

```haskell
import Prelude hiding (length)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..]  -- An infinite list of numbers
  print (length infiniteList)  -- This will never terminate
```
